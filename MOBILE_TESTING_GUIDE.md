# Mobile Testing Guide with ngrok

**Current Setup:**
- Backend: http://localhost:8080
- ngrok Tunnel: https://nonillusional-searingly-loren.ngrok-free.dev
- Frontend Web: http://localhost:5174
- Mobile App: Configured to use ngrok URL ✅

---

## Step 1: Ensure Everything is Running

### Terminal 1 - Backend (Go)
```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
# Should output: "Server running on :8080"
```

### Terminal 2 - Frontend Web (React)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Should show: "VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms"
```

### Terminal 3 - Mobile App (React Native)
```bash
cd mobile
npm start
# Follow prompts to run on your device
```

### Terminal 4 - ngrok (already running)
```
Your ngrok is active:
Forwarding: https://nonillusional-searingly-loren.ngrok-free.dev -> http://localhost:8080
```

## Step 2: Testing Workflow

### Option A: Two Devices (Recommended)

1. Log in as user
2. Log out → Export data
3. Log in as nutritionist
4. Test features
5. Log out → Switch back to user

## Step 6: Troubleshooting

### Mobile App Can't Connect to Backend
**Problem**: "Network Error" or "Connection refused"
**Solution**:
1. Verify ngrok is running: `https://nonillusional-searingly-loren.ngrok-free.dev`
2. Check backend is running: `localhost:8080`
3. Mobile device must be on same WiFi or use ngrok (already configured)
4. Restart mobile app

### OAuth/Google Login Issues
**Problem**: Google auth fails through ngrok
**Solution**:
1. Update OAuth redirect URLs in Google Console to include ngrok domain
2. Google OAuth Settings:
   - Add: `https://nonillusional-searingly-loren.ngrok-free.dev/api/auth/google/callback`
   - Add: `com.bienestarapp://auth` (mobile deep link)

### Token/Authentication Errors
**Problem**: "Unauthorized" or "Invalid token"
**Solution**:
1. Clear app data → Re-login
2. Check JWT token expiry in backend (currently 24 hours)
3. Verify Authorization header is being sent

### ngrok URL Changes
**Problem**: ngrok URL changes on restart
**Solution**:
1. Upgrade ngrok plan for static URL
2. Or update `mobile/src/api.js` with new URL
3. Restart mobile app after URL change

## Step 7: Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Consultation Flow

2. **Nutritionist**: Accept patient from pending list
3. **Nutritionist**: Create meal plan and recommendations
4. **User**: View meal plan and recommendations
5. **Both**: Exchange messages about health goals
6. **User**: Log progress and weight changes
7. **Nutritionist**: Export patient report

### Scenario 2: Meal Plan Testing
1. **Nutritionist**: Create recipe with macros
2. **Nutritionist**: Create 7-day meal plan with recipes
3. **Nutritionist**: Send plan to patient
4. **User**: View meal plan on mobile
5. **User**: View individual meal details

## Step 8: Performance Testing

### Bandwidth Check
Monitor ngrok dashboard at: http://127.0.0.1:4040

## Step 9: Debug Tools

### View Network Requests
```
# ngrok Web Interface
http://127.0.0.1:4040
- Inspect all HTTP requests/responses
- Replay requests
- Check headers and bodies
```
