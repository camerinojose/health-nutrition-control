# Expo Go Deprecated for This Project

## Why?
Expo Go no longer supports push notifications and many advanced features required by this app (as of SDK 53+). You must use a development build for all testing and development.

## What to Do
- Use EAS CLI to create a development build (see PROJECT_STATUS.md for instructions)
- Do not use Expo Go for push notifications, authentication, or any feature requiring native modules
- Remove or ignore any Expo Go-specific warnings
